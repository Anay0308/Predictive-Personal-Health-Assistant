# Self in Machine Learning  

This project explores the concept of modeling the “self” in machine learning by integrating supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches into a unified system. It demonstrates techniques for perception, representation learning, decision-making, and self-optimization, aiming to simulate aspects of autonomy and adaptive intelligence.  

## Features  
- **Supervised Learning**: Classification and regression pipelines with hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and representation learning to capture latent structure.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Policy learning for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments.  
- **Self-Optimization**: Regularization, scaling, and model selection techniques to manage bias-variance trade-offs.  
- **Evaluation**: Systematic use of metrics, cross-validation, and experimental analysis to assess performance.  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- OpenAI Gym (for RL environments)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
