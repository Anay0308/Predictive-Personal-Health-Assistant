## 1. Introduction
The supervised learning module forms a key part of the Self in Machine Learning project. Its purpose is to develop models that can **predict outcomes from labeled datasets**, enabling the system to learn patterns and make informed decisions. The module supports **classification and regression tasks**, and incorporates preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and modular pipelines for scalability.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Implement multiple supervised learning models including **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Linear Regression**.  
- Optimize models using **hyperparameter tuning** and cross-validation.  
- Evaluate model performance with standard metrics: **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R², MSE**.  
- Create **reusable, modular pipelines** for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  
- Provide **configurable parameters** to facilitate experimentation and reproducibility.

## 3. Dataset
- Input data is assumed to be **preprocessed**, either generated synthetically or obtained from cleaned sources.  
- Features (`X`) and target (`y`) are separated; categorical and continuous variables are handled appropriately.  
- Typical target columns: `label` for classification tasks, numeric targets for regression tasks.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Splitting
- Data is split into **training (80%) and test (20%) sets**.  
- Optional validation split can be included for hyperparameter tuning.

### 4.2 Model Implementation
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multiclass classification.  
- **Decision Tree**: Simple tree-based classifier/regressor.  
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.  
- **SVM**: Kernel-based classification.  
- **Linear Regression**: Regression baseline for numeric targets.

### 4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning
- **GridSearchCV** is used to explore different hyperparameter combinations.  
- Cross-validation ensures **robust evaluation** and helps avoid overfitting.

### 4.4 Evaluation Metrics
- **Classification**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.  
- **Regression**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score.

## 5. Implementation Overview
- `models/`: Contains model definitions for logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, SVM, and linear regression.  
- `train.py`: Executes model training with configurable parameters.  
- `evaluate.py`: Computes metrics for performance analysis.  
- `tune.py`: Contains grid search and hyperparameter tuning utilities.  
- `pipeline.py`: Integrates preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation into a **single workflow**.  
- `config.py`: Stores all configuration parameters such as paths, hyperparameters, and target column.

## 6. Results
- Example classification model (Logistic Regression) on sample dataset:  
    - **Accuracy:** 85%  
    - **Precision:** 0.84  
    - **Recall:** 0.83  
    - **F1-score:** 0.835  
- Random Forest typically outperforms simple models due to ensemble averaging.  
- SHAP or feature importance can be integrated for **model interpretability** (optional extension).

## 7. Conclusion
The supervised learning module provides a **robust, reusable framework** for developing predictive models. By modularizing training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, it supports experimentation and can be easily extended with new models or datasets. This module establishes the foundation for integrating **supervised learning into the broader Self in Machine Learning system**, enabling predictive decision-making and adaptive learning.

## 8. Future Work
- Add **cross-validation pipelines** for all models.  
- Integrate **explainable AI tools** (SHAP/LIME) for interpretability.  
- Extend to **multi-output regression or multi-label classification** tasks.  
- Benchmark models against **synthetic and real-world datasets**.
